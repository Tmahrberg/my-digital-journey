#### SSID
- The *Service Set Identifier (SSID)* is the human-readable name of a [[CISCO/ccna-definitions-vault-main/20 - Definitions/802.11\|Wireless Network]]
- Unlike a [[CISCO/ccna-definitions-vault-main/20 - Definitions/BSSID\|BSSID]], it does not have to be unique
- Multiple wireless networks can be configured with the same *SSID* to allow devices to roam between [[CISCO/ccna-definitions-vault-main/20 - Definitions/Wireless Access Points\|APs]] through [[CISCO/ccna-definitions-vault-main/20 - Definitions/Wireless Service Sets\|ESS]]
