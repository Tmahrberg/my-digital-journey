#### Hub
- *Hubs* are [[CISCO/ccna-definitions-vault-main/20 - Definitions/21 - OSI Layers/Layer 1\|Layer 1]] multi-port repeaters that forward (i.e. [[CISCO/ccna-definitions-vault-main/20 - Definitions/Broadcast Address\|broadcast]]) signals to all active ports
	- Used for connecting multiple [[CISCO/ccna-definitions-vault-main/20 - Definitions/Ethernet\|Ethernet]] devices together and making them act as a single network segment.
- Hubs operate in [[CISCO/ccna-definitions-vault-main/20 - Definitions/Half-Duplex\|Half-Duplex]] mode and **share the same [[CISCO/ccna-definitions-vault-main/20 - Definitions/Collision Domain\|Collision Domain]]
- Not [[CISCO/ccna-definitions-vault-main/20 - Definitions/MAC Address\|MAC]] address aware; whenever a [[CISCO/ccna-definitions-vault-main/20 - Definitions/802.3 Frames\|Frame]] is received, it is flooded out all ports apart from the one it was received on
- Hosts connected through a hub use [[CISCO/ccna-definitions-vault-main/20 - Definitions/CSMA-CD\|CSMA/CD]] to detect [[CISCO/ccna-definitions-vault-main/20 - Definitions/Collisions\|Collisions]] and resend frames
